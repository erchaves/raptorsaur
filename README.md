The Raptorsaur.com website
This is just a simple repo for a simple webpage.

### Dependencies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) â€” `$ brew install node`

### Getting started
1. `git clone https://github.com/erchaves/raptorsaur`
2. Install dependencies:
```npm install```

### Development
1. Run the builds and the local server.
```npm start```
2. View the site at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080){target="_blank"}

### Lint
```npm run lint```

#### Notes
I took some boilerplate from a build that uses google closure compiler. There's too many dependencies, but it works for now. I also realize it has a dependency on [JVM](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) which is an annoying dependency, sorry.
